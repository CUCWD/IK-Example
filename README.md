# IK Example

Implementation of Jacobian Transpose example shown at: https://medium.com/unity3danimation/overview-of-jacobian-ik-a33939639ab2

Only solvable for XY plane only

Target gameobject needs its position manually set

The joints can be extanded as required, you need to increase the joints array size

For displaying output of joint angle value, you need to increase the lbl_joint_Angles array size and add the text UI objects
